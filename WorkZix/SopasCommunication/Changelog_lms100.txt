v0.90 (28.07.2008)
------------------
CHANGES
- Scan data format of LMS100 has changed. For now both versions are supported,
  use the compile switch #define LMS100_OLD_SCANDATA to switch back to the 
  old format. Depends on the firmware version of your LMS100. The new
  format will be the default.
- Format for SetScanConfig has changed. For now both versions are supported,
  use the compile switch #define LMS100_OLD_SCANDATA to switch back to the 
  old format. Depends on the firmware version of your LMS100. The new
  format will be the default.
- Moved extraction of SLms100State and SLms100Scan from 
  CLms100SopasInterface to the according structs so that own communication 
  implementations could also use it for deserialization.

NEW FEATURES
- Added version number to device specific part of framework 
  (see CLms100SopasInterface::GetDeviceFrameworkVersion).
- Example in main-function extended: The program waits for LMS100 to reach
  measuring mode. Scandata is polled for some time and information as well 
  as the averaged 90-degree-beam are displayed.

BUGFIXES
- Possible null pointer access in CLms100SopasInterface when no answer has
  been received.
- Possible crash when deserializing scan: FlexArray length was not checked.
