Changelog for SopasCommunication (Common part)
==============================================

Note: There is also a separate changelog for each device specific part.
      (changelog_XXX.txt where XXX denotes the device name.)

v1.02 (03.11.2008)
------------------
BUGFIXES
- If an asynchronous answer (event or async method result) was received 
  directly after a synchronous answer and both answers were stored completely
  in the receive buffer the synchronous answer was discarded during 
  processing. So if e.g. an asynchronous method sent the asynchronous result 
  (sAI/sAN) very quickly after the synchronous acknowledge (sMA) the call to 
  CProtocol::InvokeAsyncMethod() could have failed although a synchronous 
  acknowledge had been received. This has been fixed.

v1.01 (14.10.2008)
------------------
CHANGES
- Password hashes and login levels are stored as global objects of
  CSopasLoginLevel class instead of being hardcoded in 
  CSopasInterface::Login(). There are default login levels (run, 
  maintenance, authorized client) defined in the SopasLoginLevel namespace.
  Other levels can be added if passwords have been changed for instance.

v1.00 (05.08.2008)
------------------
NEW FEATURES
- Asynchronous handling implemented by using a polling mechanism.
  Events and asynchronous methods are available now.

CHANGES
- Moved most parts from specific protocols (COLA-A, COLA-B) to base
  class while implementing asynchronous handling.

v0.90 (28.07.2008)
------------------
CHANGES
- Increased buffer size of read buffer (serial and TCP/IP) so that a whole
  scan fits into the buffer. Also changed Sleep(1) to Sleep(0) (WIN32 only).
  This will give a major performance improvements when receiving scan data.
  The system stays responsive during waiting. (C++/CLI only)
- Serial and TCP/IP communication now catch all exceptions during
  read or write and just return null pointer or false on error. (C++/CLI only)
- Sleep command is not portable and enclosed in #ifdef WIN32 now. Other
  platforms will do busy waiting at full processor load for now.
- Interface of CProtocol::WriteVariable changed. Return value is bool now.
- CAsciiDeserializer checks that SOPAS_FixString is followed by a separator.
- Functions in CSopasInterface check that all read data has been processed.
- Moved CColaAProtocol::GetSopasErrorCode to base class.
- Replaced pointers against references in most function arguments. Pointers 
  are only used for fixed arrays and optional parameters.
- Added null pointer checks for optional function parameters.
- Moved helper function from CColaAProtocol to CProtocol. They are also
  used by CColaBProtocol now.

NEW FEATURES
- Binary framing (CBinaryFramer) and COLA-B-protocol (CColaBProtocol) are
  implemented
- CDeserializer::DeserializeArray (flex) checks whether read data fits into 
  array.
- CDeserializer::SerializeArray (flex) checks if array current length is 
  smaller than maximum length of the array.  
- Added version number to framework (see CSopasInterface::GetFrameworkVersion).

BUGFIXES
- CAsciiDeserializer now also handles hex-strings with lower case characters.
- CBinaryDataStream::FindIndexOfNext could have looked beyond written data.
- CSerializer::Serialize(), CSerializer::GetSerializedSize() and 
  CDeserializer::Deserializer() were hidden by derived class. So they couldn't
  be called for SOPAS_FlexString and SOPAS_XByte when using the derived classes
  directly (instead of using a base-class pointer to the derived class).
